1. Choose a dataset for which the Quartet Score for Astral and Phylonet is equal or almost equal, though FN rate of Phylonet is much worse than Astral. i.e. Estimated strong ILS (11-taxon)

2. Choose a model condition, i.e. 50 genes

3. Take 1 tree from each criterion i.e. 
1 from Phylonet
1 from Astral
1 from Astral exact
1 true tree

4. generate all possible neighbour trees of these 4 trees applying SPR (i.e. 440 for each, then total 4*440 trees)

5. Calculate EL, QS, FN for all these trees (like did before)

6. Plot them in graphs (like before), i.e. 

7. Plot FN vs. QS graph, where some points should be found where quartet scores are same (Phylonet and Astral) but FN rates are are different. that is , for same value in X axis, there should be much distant values in Y axis for some points. [ This is the main target]
